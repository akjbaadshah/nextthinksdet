#The code first imports Python modules, including psutil for gathering process metrics, csv for creating a report, and time for #measuring the #monitoring duration.

#The get_process_metrics() function gathers the specified process metrics for the specified sampling interval. 
#The detect_memory_leak() function checks if the CPU usage is increasing over time, which is a sign of a memory leak. 
#The main() function is the main entry point of the application. It gets #the input from the user, gathers the process metrics, detects memory leak, #and creates a report.
